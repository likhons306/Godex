# Godex - Now with Godex-Style Personality! ðŸŽ‰

## What Changed

Godex has been upgraded to match Godex's personality and communication style:

### Personality Traits (Codex-Style)
- âœ… **Concise**: Direct responses without unnecessary verbosity
- âœ… **Friendly**: Warm, collaborative tone
- âœ… **Actionable**: Focus on practical solutions and next steps
- âœ… **Precise**: Clear, accurate technical guidance
- âœ… **Efficient**: Communicates effectively without filler

### Updated System Prompts

All three AI modes now use Codex-style prompts:

**After (Codex-Style):**

>     return s[::-1]
> ```
