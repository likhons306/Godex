# Godex: Your AI Coding Assistant

Godex is a state-of-the-art AI coding assistant designed to help developers with complex reasoning tasks in code, math, and STEM. It features a modern, real-time chat interface powered by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

This project serves as a powerful demonstration of how to build AI-native applications using the latest web technologies.

    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google Generative AI API key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

4.  **Run the development servers:**

    This command will start both the frontend and backend servers in parallel:
    ```bash
    npm run dev:all
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## scripts
